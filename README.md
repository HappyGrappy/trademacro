A fan made Path of Exile Price Checker

An ahk script that binds ctrl+p for price checking. It works by calling a java program I wrote to determine the item's price base on item name. So for now, it's mostly useful for uniques and other items like _Offering to the Goddess_.

Compatible with item-info script.
